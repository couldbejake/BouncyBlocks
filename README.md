# BouncyBlocks

This is ideal for games such as parkour.

As well as allowing custom blocks for bouncing, the plugin also allows for the 'bounce height' to be set!

Features
- Easily enable or disable bouncy blocks.
- Simple and easy config/setup
- Full permissions
- Set up a completely custom bounce config.
- Works with or without permissions! (Enable or disable it in the config)
- Choose checking modes. (Scheduled), (Movement) or (Both)

Commands / Permissions
Currently no Commands or Permissions needed! Suggestions will be taken to add more however. Currently considering adding permissions for using the bouncy blocks. Will add if suggested.
